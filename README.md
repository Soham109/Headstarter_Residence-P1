# Customer Churn Prediction and Retention System

## üìà Overview

The **Customer Churn Prediction and Retention System** is a comprehensive solution designed to predict the likelihood of customers leaving a bank (churning) and to proactively retain them through personalized email communications. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, feature engineering, and the power of the Groq API, this project not only identifies high-risk customers but also facilitates strategic interventions to enhance customer loyalty and satisfaction.

## üîç Features

- **Churn Prediction:** Utilizes robust machine learning models to accurately predict the probability of customer churn.
- **Personalized Retention Emails:** Automatically generates customized emails tailored to individual customers to encourage retention.
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Provides insightful summaries and visualizations using Plotly graphs integrated within a user-friendly Streamlit interface.
- **Advanced Techniques:** Implements feature engineering and SMOTE to handle imbalanced datasets, enhancing model performance.
- **API Integration:** Integrates with the Groq API to enrich data processing and explanation capabilities.
